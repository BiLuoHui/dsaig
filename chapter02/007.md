# Complexity analysis of algorithms

1. **Worst Case complexity**: It is the complexity of solving the problem for the worst input of size n. It provides the upper bound for the algorithm. This is the most common analysis done.
2. **Average Case complexity:** It is the complexity of solving the problem on an average. We calculate the time for all the possible inputs and then take an average of it.
3. **Best Case complexity**: It is the complexity of solving the problem for the best input of size n.
