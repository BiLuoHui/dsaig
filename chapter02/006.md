# Theta-Θ Notation

Definition: “f(n) is theta of g(n).” or f(n) = Θ(g(n)) if there are three +ve constants c1, c2 and n0 such that `c1 g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2 g(n)` for all `n ≥ n0`

Function g(n) is an asymptotically tight bound on f(n). Function f(n) grows at the same rate as g(n).

Example: $n^3 + n^2 + n = Ɵ(n^3)$
Example: $n^2 + n = Ɵ(n^2)$

Find relationship of $f(n) = 2n^2 + n$  and $g(n) = n^2$
`f(n) = O(g(n))`
`f(n) = Ɵ(g(n))`
`f(n) = Ω(g(n))`

Note:- Asymptotic Analysis is not perfect, but that is the best way available for analyzing algorithms.

For example, say there are two sorting algorithms first tak`e f(n) = 10000*n*log(n)` and `second f(n) = n^2` time. The asymptotic analysis says that the first algorithm is better (as it ignores constants) but actually for a small set of data when n is small then 10000, the second algorithm will perform better. To consider this drawback of asymptotic analysis case analysis of the algorithm is introduced.
