An algorithm is a set of steps to accomplish a task. Or an algorithm in a computer program in which a set of steps applied over a set of input to produce a set of output.

算法是完成任务的一系列步骤。 或者计算机程序中的算法，是将一些输入转化为输出。

Knowledge of algorithm helps us to get desired result faster by applying the right algorithm.

算法知识通过应用正确的算法帮助我们更快地获得所需的结果。

The most important properties of an algorithm are:

算法最重要的属性是：

1. Correctness: The algorithm should be correct. It should be able to process all the given inputs and provide correct output.正确性：算法应该是正确的。 它应该能够处理所有给定的输入并提供正确的输出。

2. Efficiency: The algorithm should be efficient in solving problems. Efficiency is measured in two parameters. Firs is Time-Complexity, how fast result is provided by an algorithm. And the second is SpaceComplexity, how much RAM that an algorithm is going to consume to give desired result.

Time-Complexity is represented by function T(n) - time versus the input size n. Space-Complexity is represented by function S(n) - memory used versus the input size n.
