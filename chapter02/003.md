# Asymptotic analysis

Asymptotic analysis is used to compare the efficiency of algorithm independently of any particular data set or programming language.

We are generally interested in the order of growth of some algorithm and not interested in the exact time required for running an algorithm. This time is also called Asymptotic-running time.
