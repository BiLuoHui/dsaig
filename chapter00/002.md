# 学习计划

Given the limited time you have before your next interview, it is important to have a solid preparation plan. The preparation plan depends upon the time and companies you are planning to target. Below are the three-preparation plan for 1 Month, 3 Month and 5 Month durations.

鉴于您在下一次面试之前的时间有限，制定扎实的准备计划非常重要。 准备计划取决于您计划定位的时间和公司。 以下是1个月，3个月和5个月的三个准备计划。

## 1 Month Preparation Plans

Below is a list of topics and approximate time user need to finish these topics. These are the most important chapters that must be prepared before appearing for an interview.

以下是用户完成这些主题所需的主题和大致时间列表。 这些是在出现面试之前必须准备的最重要的章节。

This plan should be used when you have a limited preparation time for an interview. These chapters cover 90% of data structures and algorithm based interview questions. In this plan since we are reading about the various ADT and Go collections (or built in data structures.) in chapter 4 so we can use these datatype easily without knowing the internal details how they are implemented.

如果您的面试准备时间有限，则应使用此计划。 这些章节涵盖了90％的数据结构和基于算法的面试问题。 在本计划中，我们正在阅读第4章中关于各种ADT和Go集合（或内置数据结构）的内容，因此我们可以轻松使用这些数据类型，而无需了解内部详细信息的实现方式。

Chapter 24 is for system design, you must read this chapter if you have three or more years of experience. Anyway, reading this chapter will give the reader a broader perspective of various designs.

第24章是系统设计，如果你有三年或更多年的经验，你必须阅读本章。 无论如何，阅读本章将为读者提供更广泛的各种设计视角。

|Time|Chapters|Explanation|
|:---|:-------|:----------|
|Week 1|Chapter 1: Introduction -Programming Overview<br>Chapter 2: Algorithms Analysis<br>Chapter 3: Approach To Solve Algorithm Design Problems<br>Chapter 4: Abstract Data Type & Go Collections|You will get a basic understanding of how to find complexity of a solution. <br>You will know how to handle new problems. <br>You will read about a variety of datatypes and their uses.|
|Week 2|Chapter 5: Searching<br>Chapter 6: Sorting<br>Chapter 14: String Algorithms|Searching, Sorting and String algorithm consists of a major portion of the interviews.|
|Week 3|Chapter 7: Linked List<br>Chapter 8: Stack<br>Chapter 9: Queue|Linked list, Stack and Queue are one of the favorites in an interview.|
|Week 4|Chapter 10: Tree<br>Chapter 23: Interview Strategy<br>Chapter 24: System Design|This portion you will read about Trees and System Design. You are good to go for interviews. Best of luck.|

## 3 Month Preparation Plan

This plan should be used when you have some time to prepare for an
interview. This preparation plan includes nearly everything in this book except
various algorithm techniques. Algorithm problems that are based on “dynamic
programming”, “divide & conquer” etc. Which are asked in vary specific
companies like Google, Facebook, etc. Therefore, until you are planning to
face interview with them you can park these topics for some time and focus on
the rest of the topics.

Again, same thing here with system design problems, the more experience you
are, the more important this chapter becomes. However, if you are a fresher
from college, then also you should read this chapter.

|Week 4 & Week 5|Chapter 7: Linked List<br>Chapter 8: Stack<br>Chapter 9: Queue|Linked list, Stack and Queue are one of the favorites in an interview.|
|Week 6 & Week 7|Chapter 10: Tree<br>Chapter 11: Heap|This portion you will read about trees and heap data structures.|
|Week 8 & Week 9|Chapter 12: Hash-Table<br>Chapter 13: Graphs|Hash-Table is used throughout this book in various places, but now it is time to understand how Hash-Table are actually implemented. <br>Graphs are used to propose a solution many real life problems.|
|Week 10|Chapter 23: Interview Strategy<br>Chapter 24: System Design|Interview strategy and system design chapter are the final chapters of this course.|
|Week 11 & Week 12|Revision of the chapters listed above.|At this time, you need to revise all the chapters that we have seen in this book. <br>Whatever is left needs to be completed and the exercise that may be left needing to be solved in this time.|

## 5 Month Preparation Plan

This preparation plan is made on top of 3-month plan. In this plan, students
should look for algorithm design chapters. In addition, in the rest of the time
they need to practice more and more from www.topcoder.com and other
resources. If you are targeting google, Facebook, etc., Then it is highly
recommended to join topcoder and practice as much as possible.
