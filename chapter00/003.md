These are few preparation plans that can be followed to complete this book
while preparing for the interview. It is highly recommended that you should
read the problem statement, try to solve the problems by himself and then only
you should look into the solution to find the approach of this book. Practicing
more and more problems will increase your thinking capacity and you will be
able to handle new problems in an interview. System design is a topic that is
not asked much from a college fresher, but as you gain experience its
importance increase. We will recommend practicing all the problems given in
